& Responsible for the managerial and development aspects of providing releases of the company's CMS product to various environments to support business continuity.  \\[0.4em]
    
& The management side of this role involves communicating with other teams to ensure that their schedules are on time for the next release and working to resolve any blockers that they may encounter. This requires me to spend a lot of time with staff, working through their build issues, scheduling problems and discussing best implementation methods for designing their service changes.  \\[0.4em]
    
& Very hands on with development, focusing on designing and implementing build processes. This is often programmatically declared using languages such as groovy and bash, which are normally accompanied by Jenkins' jobs. Maintenance and improvement of these processes and scripts are core to the continuous delivery of the product. Often in technical meetings, with various levels of management, around how best to improve our processes and the benefits of the proposed solutions.  \\[0.4em]

& Operational tasks are occasionally required as issues arise in deployment environments, which need to be taken care of before the install process can continue. Acquired good experience with command line and managing Linux based services such as solr, rabbitmq, oracle database, sshd and more. Currently involved in a project, migrating a bricks and mortar system to a cloud-based container system.
